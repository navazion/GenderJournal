# GenderJournal
For AP English.

Code has been used for educational purposes from CodePen, W3 Schools, and helpful people on StackOverflow. No code is meant to intentionally seem like mine. I did not code any of the moving parts of any of the pages. Specifically:
The flower on the FEMALE page.
The mountains on the OTHER page.

I did, however, design all 3 logos.
