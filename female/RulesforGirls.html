      <h3><b>RULES FOR GIRLS</b></h3>
         <h4><i>Inspired by "The Rules".</i></h4>
      <h5 style="text-align: left;">
      <ol>
       <li>If he asks you out, silently stand there. Stare at his face. Is that a face you want to spend time with? And even then, is it a face you want to be seen with? Consider everything. How does his hair look as he is asking you out? He must have thought some of his appearance through before talking to you. If he didn’t, then say no. He obviously does not care about the relationship before it even starts, so who is to say if he will ever care? If he looks good, and you think he looks good, wait a few days before confirming.</li>

<li>If you do end up going out with a guy, and make sure that he’s a guy, don’t call him. Even if you feel mean about calling him, who calls anyone these days? At most, text him to confirm plans. Do not text about anything else. If he tries to start a conversation with you over text, ignore them all. If he asks why you aren’t responding, say you were busy with something (e.g., I was in the shower, I was cooking, I was reading, I was coding). If he asks you to call him, call him, at most: once. No more. Possibly less.</li>

<li>If he asks you out for ice cream, stare at him. Who eats ice cream? And don’t you have some kind of weight to watch? And if he calls them jimmies, break up with him on the spot.</li>

<li>When walking down the street, if he tries to hold your hand and you haven’t seen him wash his hands yourself, put your hands in your pockets. You can never be too safe.</li>

<li>These rules are written in stone, but how you do them will depend on your temperament. If you’re overly nice, you better tattoo these rules to your forearm so you remember them and you can never forget them. If you’re already cool and aloof, please call 1-800-GIRL-RULES and ask to speak to Marcia. You’re hired.</li>

<li>If your man is being a bad boy, like if he’s taking you for granted or if you want to shake things up to make him propose faster, take a trip. Most other sources will suggest a trip for about a week, but that is far too short. Take two or three weeks if you want him to want you more; take a month or two if you want him to propose to you. Be sure he knows when you are coming back from your trip so that he knows when he should propose (at the airport, of course!).</li>

<li>If you are unsure about him, double date with a trusted friend who also follows these rules. Preferably one who, as per number 5, tattooed the rules on her forearm. </li>

<li>Be wary of all men. They will want to irk you or make you nervous constantly, regardless of how they feel about you. Because of this, the more paranoid you are, the better. If he knows that you are paranoid, he will be more careful around you, and thus less likely to irk you so often. Make sure you are constantly on edge or else he will not get the hint (sometimes men do not see the hints we so obviously leave). </li>

<li>Let him know that you’re fine with being alone. In fact, if you have more than two close friends other than him, make sure you take the trip, as per number 6, by yourself. Possibly rent a house out there or at least do not move in with him until he proposes. That way, he has to make couple life better than single life.</li>

<li>Get angry if he’s taking longer than you’d like to propose. If he knew you at all, he would know that you just want to get married already. Make sure he knows that you want him to propose. Watch The Bachelor and The Bachelorette constantly, look longingly at rings in store cabinets, and watch proposals on YouTube while he is around. </li>

<li>Don’t get sloppy about your looks. Continue to stay fit-- especially if you’re dating one of the ice cream eaters-- and make sure you are constantly buying new clothes. Keep him drooling over you. </li>

<li>Make sure he reads the newspaper so that you two have something to talk about. After all, you two will be spending a lot more time together than you think and the last thing you need in that kind of relationship is dead air. </li>
