<p style="word-wrap:break-word; font-size: 12pt">I created this GenderJournal with help from Ms. Florio, Ms. Barrett, and Mr. LaRocca. I originally thought of this idea because I wanted a GenderJournal that was not made of paper or some kind of craft. I wanted a Journal that everyone could look at on their own time-- so I knew it had to be something on the internet. I also took Intro/Honors Computer Science and AP Computer Science during my time at Northern Highlands and I recognized that there were less girls in those classes than any of my others. There were only a handful of us, maybe four or five <i>max, </i> so I thought it would be interesting to show a girl's code. Then I thought of websites and how some of them change between the mobile version and the desktop version and I knew I could do a website with different "experiences" for each gender. From there, the project basically designed itself.
