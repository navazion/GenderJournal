    <p> Inspired by a class discussion.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I wake up, my eyes blinded by the light that is streaming in through the rafters. The ceiling has not been fixed in who-knows-how long, but no one else seems to mind. I shake off the sleep before getting up on my legs. I can hear others wake up around me, ready for another day at work, another day to toil and toss around.</p>

<p>  I shuffle up to the door of my room and knock against it, hoping for some kind of attention. When I get none, I get concerned. There’s usually someone just beyond the door by now, someone waiting for me to be up and about. Today there isn’t.</p>

<p>  I look around the room before realizing the obvious: my neighbor is gone. He’s just not there. Last night I was sure I fell asleep to his snores and now he is gone. </p>

<p>I desperately knock against the door again, trying to break free, but to no avail. It is at this point that I look up at the rafters again. Weak, weak, weak-- I need to get out. I need to get out. I need to get out….</p>
