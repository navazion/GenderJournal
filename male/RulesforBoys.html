    <p> Inspired by "The Rules".</p>
    <br><br>
    <ol> 
<li>When you ask her out, expect an instant answer if she’s interested. If she waits a few seconds before answering, be cautious. What did she have to think about in the first place?</li>
 <br>

<li>Call her every day. Make sure that it’s you she’s thinking about. If she doesn’t call you, be only slightly concerned. Some girls just don’t like to call their guy.</li>
 <br>

<li>Ask her out to ice cream or to a football game. If she says “yes”, she’s genuinely interested in going. If she gives you some kind of side-answer, such as “yeah” or “sure”, be cautious. She might be hard to get-- be sure she’s not hard to be around. </li>
 <br>

<li>When walking down the street, hold her hand. If she drops it, stare at it for a second and wait a few minutes before going to hold it again. </li>
 <br>

<li>The Rules are written in stone, but how you do them will depend on your temperament. If you’re a bad boy, live, breathe, eat, and sleep The Rules. The closer you follow them, the better. That is, constantly call her and make sure you know where she is all the time. 
But if you’re naturally a gentleman, be simply familiar with The Rules. Call her two times for every call she gives you. As long as you’re not clingy or over-aggressive, you can show her you like her all you want. </li>
 <br>

<li>If she’s being a little picky or taking you for granted, talk to her. If she can’t have a conversation with you, then it might be time to reconsider your relationship. Someone who is not willing to communicate is not one worth attempting to communicate with. Mutual discussions are necessary to foster a healthy relationship. Perhaps propose a week get-away for the two of you: “Nothing to worry about, honey, just some R and R.”</li>
 <br>

<li>If you are unsure about her, double date with a Rules minded friend. He will tell you whether she’s planning to break up with you or not. </li>
 <br>

<li>Even girls who are in love with you and want to marry you will occasionally say things to make you extremely happy and extremely sad, just to see how you will react, such as: “I have to cancel our weekend plans because my mom’s daughter is busy that day.” Most guys will make a big fuss about the situation and possibly break up with her. However, Rules guys keep it together when girls tease them and push their buttons. </li>
 <br>

<li>Don’t let her know you’re afraid to be alone. We all are, but girls want to know that they can trust you to be by yourself but also by their side when they need it. </li>
 <br>

<li>Don’t get angry if she’s considering your marriage proposal. If you’ve been in a relationship long enough, then she already has an answer in mind. If she is considering your proposal for longer than you think she needs, then maybe it’s a sign that it wasn’t meant to be.</li>
<br>

<li>Don’t get sloppy about your looks. Keep in shape-- girls like a guy who can not only hold their hand but hold their body above his head whenever they want. Do push-ups randomly around her to show her that you really are exercising.</li>
 <br>

<li>Read the Life magazines and different books you see her interested in. You two should not only be able to talk about your professions but also what is going on in the world. Keep her fulfilled mentally, physically, and emotionally. Happy wife, happy life. </li>
<br>
