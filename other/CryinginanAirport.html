<h1>CRYING IN AN AIRPORT.</h1>
<h2><i>Inspired by: "Speaking While Female".</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Count all the popcorn kernels in the world and then realize there are more reasons than that to be crying in an airport. They’re unfortunate places, regardless if you’re going to Oswego or Boulder, and the expired bottles of juice and sandwiches sold in tiny carry-on containers in little kiosks aren’t helpful. People bawling their eyes out on the airport chairs as if they’re sofa beds have it bad. And when a child passes by, nibbling on what looks to be a communion wafer, or another kid, running to catch up to their parents as they practice their catching with their favorite mitt and ball, they stop to see this shell of a person who is losing more dihydrogen monoxide in five minutes than the airport can sell in a single bottle. And then I can not help but stare, too. Then it’s like the three of us are in some kind of exclusive club, as if those kids showed fake IDs to get in and I am some kind of bouncer who wrongly let them in. I feel like I betrayed the person crying in an airport. I hope, for their sake, that it’s not about some boy or some girl or some other gender that has yet to be recognized by the US government. </p>
<p>No, I hope that they’re crying because they ordered some chinese food right before they got to the airport and the delivery guy looked just like their third-grade teacher who they cherished so much that they tipped the delivery guy 100 bucks. The delivery guy didn’t understand but that wasn’t the point.</p>
<p>No, I hope they’re crying because they had bought the wrong kind of shoe polish because their shoes turned out to be navy blue, not black, and now they had to fly home from a job interview where they shined their blue shoes with black polish and the interviewer didn’t even notice but that doesn’t matter because they shined their blue shoes with black polish.</p>
<p>No, I hope they’re crying because they had packed a bag of tootsie rolls but because of just their luck all the tootsies had unrolled and melted together, creating this huge tootsie-monster and now they can’t share any of their tootsie rolls with anyone else.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to be crying in an airport. And I feel so guilty when I see it because I feel as though I have to go sit by them and say: “Listen, if you’re crying about a guy, a girl, or an other, you need to stop right now. Just put your hands down and absorb all that water back into your body because there are other things to cry about and other places to cry. Right now isn’t the place because who wants to sit on a plane trip for more than two hours with a sniffly nose and bad feelings? That’s right: no one. Now’s not the time to curl up like a possum or armadillo or what-have-you. Now’s the time to play go-fish on those coffee tables with strangers so the flight isn’t weird when you have to sit next to them and neither of you want to talk. And also someone might steal your bag if you’re not watching it in the airport. I’ve been watching it for a bit to make sure no one does steal it but that kid with the mitt might being eyeing it up too. I can’t really tell with baseball players these days.”</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to be crying in an airport. Make sure yours is a good one. </p>
