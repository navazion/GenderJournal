<h1>HOW TO WRITE A TEXT MESSAGE.</h1>
<h2><i>Inspired by: being a 21st century teen.</i></h2>
<br>



 
<p>In the 21st century, it is almost impossible to get by without a phone. And, with a phone in hand, the most optimal form of communication-- among other things-- is texting. But texting can be a difficult endeavor for those who are unaccustomed to the steps it takes to both compose a text message and send one. Luckily, the correct steps have been documented here for further use and convenience.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;padding-left:50px;">
<li>Obtain a phone. There are many ways to get a hold of a phone; the easiest way to do so is to simply buy one. If this is not an option, ask parental figures. If this is not an option, illegal actions may have to be taken. These are not endorsed by this textbook.</li>

<li>Obtain the number of the person you would like to text. This can be done different ways, but it is suggest to simply ask for it. Of course, there are other options (mainly stealing it, but again, those actions are not endorsed).</li>

<li>Open the texting application. This application (hereafter simply called ‘app’) will have some kind of image associated with it that has some kind writing or a speaking-bubble reminiscent of those from comic strips. To open the app, it is common to simply tap on it. Other apps may require voice recognition-- who knows what apps are doing these days.</li>

<li>Type in the number. The number can also be in the contacts option of the phone. In this case, use the contacts. It is an easier way to access the digits of the person you would like to text.</li>

<li>Take a deep breath. At this point, there should already be some kind of an idea forming as to what to write. If there is not, do not worry. A simple beginning to a conversation can be any of the following:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;padding-left:50px;">
<li>Hey</li>
<li>Heyy</li>
<li>Hello</li>
<li>hi</li>
<li>yo</li>
<li>what’s good</li>
<li>wassup </li>
<li>Have you seen any cute kitten pictures recently?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consider the audience. What is the relationship with this person? Are they the informal ‘tu’ or the formal ‘usted’ (thou and you in English respectively)? This should change how the message is composed. If the person is informal, it is acceptable to use lowercase letters, no punctuation, and acronyms as well as abbreviations for words (eg. you vs u). If they are formal, all normal writing procedures should be followed.</li>

<li>Compose the message. Take everything into consideration. Take the time to carefully type out, using only the thumbs, the message that needs to be sent to this person.</li>

<li>Double check. Make sure that there are absolutely no typos.</li>

<li>Make sure the message should still be sent. During all this time, did the relationship with the person change? Did they post something on SnapChat? </li>

<li>If everything is confirmed, hit send. Now just hold your breath (and breathe occasionally).</li>
</ol>
