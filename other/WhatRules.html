var sentence = "<p>When they ask you out, silently count to " + NUMBER + " before saying yes. It will make them nervous and that’s good!</p> <p>Don’t call them even when you feel mean about not calling them. If they love you, they’ll call anyway. When they ask you to call him, call them " + NUMBER1 + " times. Do the absolute minimum!</p> <p>When they asks you to " + ACTIVITY + ", " + ACTIVITY1 + ", or " + ACTIVITY2 + " when you wish you were going to " + ACTIVITY3 + ", say ‘" + EXCLAMATION + "!’ Remember, you’re hard to get but easy to be with! You’ll " + ACTIVITY3 + " another time.</p> <p>When walking down the street, drop <i>they’re </i>" + BODYPART + " first, ever so slightly.</p> <p><i>The Rules</i> are written in stone, but how you do them will depend on your temperament. If you’re an overly nice, " + ADJECTIVE + " person, do <i>The Rules</i> like boot camp. The stricter, the better, that is, never call them, or return their phone calls very infrequently.</p> <p>But if you’re already " + ADJECTIVE1 + " or " + ADJECTIVE2 + " by nature, be extra " + ADJECTIVE3 + " when you do <i>The Rules</i>. Call them " + NUMBER2 + " time for every " + NUMBER3 + " times they call you. Be affectionate. As long as you’re not " + INGVERB + " or " + INGVERB1 + " or " + INGVERB2 + ", you can show them you like them a little more on each date.</p> <p>If they’re being a bad partner, taking you for granted, or you want to shake things up to make them propose faster, book a trip for a week. If things are going well but you still want to make them miss you, plan a weekend away with a friend. Tell them a week before you go, in a very innocent, sweet voice, that you’re going to " + LOCATION + " with your friend to get a tan and relax. ‘Nothing serious, " + NICKNAME + ", just some R & R.’</p> <p>If you are unsure about them, double date with a <i>Rules</i>-minded friend. They will tell you whether they’re planning to marry you or not.</p> <p>Even people who are in love with you and want to marry you will occasionally say things to irk you or make you nervous, such as, “I’ll take you there if we’re still seeing each other next year… you know how relationships go.” Don’t get paranoid, just ignore them. Most girls would make a big fuss about it and get mad. <i>Rules</i> girls stay " + ADJECTIVE4 + " when people tease them. </p> <p>Don’t let them know you’re afraid to be alone, to be without someone there. People who let others know how much they need to be with someone invite bad behavior. Then they knows you’ll put up with anything not to be alone.</p> <p>Don’t get angry if they’re taking longer than you’d like to propose. Most people want to be proposed to on a " + DAYOFTHEWEEK + ". Whatever you do, don’t blow up at them and press the issue. You’ve waited this long, hang in there. If you’re doing The Rules, it will happen!</p> <p>Don’t get sloppy about your looks. Continue to exercise. People don’t leave others who put on " + NUMBER4 + " pounds after the wedding or the first baby, but if you want your special someone to keep drooling over you, keep fit. </p><p>Read the newspaper and books so you can talk to your life partner about things other than you work issues or dirty diapers, such as " + NOUN1 + ", " + NOUN2 + ", or " + NOUN3 + ". People want others who can fulfill them mentally as well as physically and emotionally.</p>";
